The site received strong scores overall. It took a while for me to figure out how to increase my SEO score from a 67 to the 100 that it is now. Once I realized I needed to include a strong meta description, I was able to increase the score.

My lowest score remains "Best Practices." Lighthouse says my images are putting out too small of a resolution. I'm not sure if this would be fixed by simply using larger photos, but we were told to keep images small for the assignment, so I decided to leave this as-is.
